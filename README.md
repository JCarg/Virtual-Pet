# Virtual-Pet

Thanks for using Virtual Pet. It is a program that simulates 
the basic needs of a pet and allows the user to take care of those needs.
The user has the ability to choose the name of the pet and also the way
to care for the pet's needs. They can either choose between allowing the 
pet to sleep, feed, play, or take medicine. The user must be vigilant of
their pet's parameters, for if they should reach a certain level the user will lose
them.
